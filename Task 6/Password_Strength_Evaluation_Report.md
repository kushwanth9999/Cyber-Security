## 💡 Tips Learned from Evaluation

- ✅ Use at least **12 characters**
- ✅ Combine **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**
- ✅ Avoid common words and predictable patterns
- ✅ Use passphrases or random character sequences
- ✅ Longer and more random = stronger
- ✅ Use a **password manager** for secure storage

## 🔓 Common Password Attacks

- **Brute Force:** Tries every combination — long passwords slow it down
- **Dictionary Attack:** Uses known common passwords — avoid real words
- **Rainbow Table:** Matches precomputed hashes — salt and uniqueness matter

## ✅ Final Thoughts

Understanding how password strength works helps protect against modern cyber threats. Use strong, unique passwords and store them safely with a password manager. Avoid reusing passwords across sites and always enable two-factor authentication.
