# Firewall Summary and Traffic Filtering

## üîí What is a Firewall?
A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on pre-set rules.

## üîç How Does It Filter Traffic?

1. **Source and Destination IPs**
   - Allows or blocks traffic based on origin and destination addresses.

2. **Ports and Protocols**
   - Filters using port numbers and transport protocols like TCP/UDP.

3. **Traffic Direction**
   - **Inbound** rules manage data coming into the device.
   - **Outbound** rules manage data leaving the device.

4. **Applications**
   - Some firewalls can filter traffic by the software generating the traffic.

5. **Stateful Inspection**
   - Remembers allowed sessions and ensures only related responses are accepted.
