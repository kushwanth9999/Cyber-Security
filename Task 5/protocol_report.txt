Summary of Findings – Packet Analysis Report
============================================

Capture Info:
-------------
- Filename: network_capture.pcapng
- Duration: Approx. 1–2 minutes
- Traffic Sources: Browser activity, ping to google.com

Protocols Identified:
----------------------
1. DNS: Resolves domain names to IP addresses (used during domain lookup)
2. TCP: Reliable connection-oriented protocol (used for web communication)
3. HTTP: Web protocol for content requests over port 80
4. ICMP: Ping requests and replies (used to test network connectivity)
5. TLS: Encrypted HTTPS traffic over port 443

Sample Packet Details:
----------------------
1. DNS Query
   - Source IP: Local IP (e.g., 192.168.x.x)
   - Destination IP: DNS server
   - Query: google.com
   - Response: IP address returned

2. TCP 3-Way Handshake
   - SYN -> SYN-ACK -> ACK sequence
   - Establishes reliable TCP connection

3. HTTP GET Request
   - Source Port: Dynamic (e.g., 54231)
   - Destination Port: 80
   - Request: GET / HTTP/1.1

4. ICMP Echo Request/Reply
   - Ping generated Type 8 (request) and Type 0 (reply) packets

5. TLS Packets
   - Port: 443
   - Info: Encrypted handshake (Client Hello, Server Hello)

Conclusion:
-----------
This task involved capturing and analyzing live network traffic to identify protocol behavior and interactions. It demonstrates real-world usage of DNS, TCP, HTTP, TLS, and ICMP in everyday web communication and connectivity testing.
